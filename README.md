Threat Intelligence solution

https://www.securityrabbits.com/

I'm Jean-Luc Dupont, and I do security. One of the daunting tasks in my job is to read daily threat intelligences from various sources. I need to get the list of the latest vulnerabilities, patches, attacks, indicators of compromise, ... The list goes on an on.

At the end of the day, I rely on my curated list but still, this takes too much time.

I'm also a programmer, so I made a program that gathers and sends most of the information I need to my mail box everyday, in a condensed format. Enter Security Rabbits.

Some of my colleagues and peers find it useful, so I've made it public. It's as simple as that.
